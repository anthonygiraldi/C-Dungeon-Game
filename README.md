Title: C++ Class Based Dungeon Game <br>
Description: <br>
The aim of this project was to make a class-based interactive text based game using C++. I selected a dungeon crawling game that would be played through the console. I set up many different classes using their respective header files and files. <br><p>The Inventory class was used to initialize the players inventory, and add functions that can add and subtract from said inventory. <br><p>The Map class is used to both provide functions that generate the map and functions that move the player around the map. <br><p>The Monster class creates different types of monsters to that the player can fight.
