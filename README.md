Title: C++ Class Based Dungeon Game <br>
Description: <br>
The aim of this project was to make a class-based interactive text based game using C++. I selected a dungeon crawling game that would be played through the console. I set up many different classes using their respective header files and files. 
<br><p>The Inventory class was used to initialize the players inventory, and add functions that can add and subtract from said inventory. 
<br><p>The Map class is used to both provide functions that generate the map and functions that move the player around the map. 
<br><p>The Monster class creates different types of monsters to that the player can fight. These monsters are pulled from a text file that lsts the monster and it's level. The class contains functions that can retrieve monsters of different levels. 
<br><p>The Party class contains functions that prompt the player to name their party members who they will bring into the dungeon along with functions that display the party's status and change the party's statistics.
<br><p>The Status class displays the status of how many rooms were cleared as well as the ammount of keys that the party has. 
<br><p>The gameDriver file is where the game will be played. This file uses all classes in order to properly structure the game.
